## Graph Data File Format
The graph data files need to follow the rule below. `<endpoint n>` needs to be an int (node id)

```
<endpoint 1> <endpoint 2>
<endpoint 3> <endpoint 4>
.
.
.
```

Let's say there is a graph like this.
![](https://i.ibb.co/g6F8pfv/images-dragged.jpg)

The following data (`graph/simple_graph.gr`) represents this simple graph with 9 nodes and 12 edges, which are <0, 1>, ..., <7, 8>.

```
0 1
0 2
1 2
1 3
2 3
2 7
3 4
3 5
4 6
5 6
5 8
7 8
```

## How to Run the Program
Try the following command to get an instant result.

```
sh run.sh all graph/simple_graph.gr
```
